For the publication of a post, the insertion of a title and a description is required. it is also possible to insert images and the destinations visited.
A list of post previews can be viewed in a special section on the user page.
The preview of a post shows its title, images and a brief statistic (number of comments and likes) and eventually allows its deletion.
It also allows you to go to the page dedicated to viewing the post in full.
A user can interact with another user's post by liking and commenting. it is possible to like both from the preview of the post, and on the full view page.
